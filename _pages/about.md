I recently graduated from the University of Oxford and recieved a PhD in Statistics. My supervisors were [Dino Sejdinovic](https://sejdino.github.io/) and [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/).

My CV can be found [here](http://veitwild.github.io/files/cv_wild.pdf).

During my PhD my research focused on generalised Bayesian methods in function spaces. In particular I used tools from infinite-dimensional Analysis to improve the theoretical understanding and develop new machine learning algorithms with better uncertainity quantification. 

If you take an interest in these subjects, feel free to reach out to me at veit.wild at gmail.com!
