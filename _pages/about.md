I recently graduated from the University of Oxford and recieved a PhD in Statistics. My supervisors were [Dino Sejdinovic](https://sejdino.github.io/) and [George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/).

During my PhD my research focused on generalised Bayesian methods in function and parameter space. In particular I used tools from infinite-dimensional Analysis to improve the theoretical understanding and develop new machine learning algorithms with better uncertainity quantification.
