I am currently a 2nd PhD Student in Machine Learning and Statistics at the University of Oxford. My supervisor is [Dino Sejdinovic](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~sejdinov/) in the Department of Statistics. My CV can be found [here](http://veitwild.github.io/files/cv_wild.pdf).

My research focusses on the use of modern probability theory to improve statistical inference.
In particular I have worked on Gaussian measures in (infinite dimensional) Hilbert and Banach spaces. I am currently most interested in how we can leverage Gaussian measures and the function space perspective to improve the uncertainty quantification for large scale Machine Learning applications. 

If you take an interest in these subjects, feel free to reach out to me at veit.wild@stats.ox.ac.uk!
