The slides for a talk I gave about how we can use Gaussian Measures on the space of square-integrable functions to construct a highly flexible inference framework. We obtain state-of-the art results on benchmark data sets by combining deep neural networks with Gaussian measures in a novel way. The slides can be found [here](http://veitwild.github.io/files/GWI_present.pdf)
